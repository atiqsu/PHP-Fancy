PHP-Fancy is an AJAX CRUD framework for PHP. It's not Crude, it's Fancy...

PHP-Fancy is based on some Open Source projects:

- ADOdb: http://adodb.sourceforge.net/
- jQuery: http://jquery.com/
- Jeditable plugin for jQuery: http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable

The working example uses Smarty (http://www.smarty.net), but it's not mandatory.

--- Getting started

The framework core consists of 4 files:

.
 |- classes
 |  |- Configuration.php
 |  |- Database.php
 |  |- FancyMapper.php
 |
 | -ajax
    |- fancyhandler.php

jQery and Jeditable scripts are located in the 'js' folder.
ADOdb and Smarty are in the 'libs' folder and CCS files are located in the 'css' folder.
Pretty simple, huh?

NOTE:
If you want to use Smarty, please read the comment in the classes/Display.php class.

The example use of the FancyMapper class is presented in the index.php file, which uses Smarty (via the Display class) to render the page using the template located in templates/index.tpl.

I recomend using Smarty on any other template engine for separating PHP from HTML code.

Enjoy.
